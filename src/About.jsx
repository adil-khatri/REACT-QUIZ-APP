        A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to
        answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects.
        Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar
        fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills. They can
        also be televised for entertainment purposes, often in a game show
        format.

        The earliest known examples of the word date back to 1780; its etymology
        is unknown, but it may have originated in student slang. It initially
        meant an "odd, eccentric person"[a] or a "joke, hoax". Later (perhaps by
        association with words such as "inquisitive") it came to mean "to
        observe, study intently", and thence (from about mid-19th century)
        "test, exam."[2][3] There is a well-known myth about the word quiz that
        says that in 1791 a Dublin theatre owner named Richard Daly made a bet
        that he could introduce a word into the language within 24 hours. He
        then went out and hired a group of street children to write the word
        "quiz", which was a nonsense word, on walls around the city of Dublin.
        Within a day, the word was common currency and had acquired a meaning
        (since no one knew what it meant, everyone thought it was some sort of
        test) and Daly had some extra cash in his pocket.[4] However, there is
        no evidence to support the story, and the term was already in use before
        the alleged bet in 1791.

        Additionally, a personality quiz may be a series of multiple-choice
        questions about the respondent without right or wrong answers. The
        responses to these questions are tallied according to a key, and the
        result purports to reveal some quality of the respondent. This kind of
        "quiz" was originally popularized by women's magazines such as
        Cosmopolitan. They have since become common on the Internet, where the
        result page typically includes code which can be added to a blog entry
        to publicize the result. These postings are common on many sites like
        LiveJournal. The results of online quizzes are generally to be taken
        lightly, as they do not often reflect the true personality or
        relationship. They are also rarely psychometrically valid. However, they
        may occasion reflection on the subject of the quiz and provide a
        springboard for a person to explore his or her emotions, beliefs,
        actions or to put some already acquired knowledge to the test.
